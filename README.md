ðŸŽ™ A lightweight Swift package for speech recognition and synthesis on iOS.  
Built for modern Swift apps, tested with Swift Testing, and ready for SwiftUI.

---

## Features

- âœ… `SpeechRecognizer` â€” handles speech-to-text with configurable language support and UI callbacks
- âœ… `SpeechSynthesizer` â€” speaks text aloud with adjustable pitch, rate, and language
- âœ… Child-friendly defaults for storytelling apps
- âœ… Modern `@Observable` state management (no delegates!)
- âœ… Safe fallback behavior and clear error reporting
- âœ… Fully documented with DocC-style comments
- âœ… Tested using Swift's native `import Testing` framework

---

## Installation

Use **Swift Package Manager** to add the library:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/michaelborgmann/SpeechKit.git", from: "0.1.0")
```

Then import it in your code:

```swift
import SpeechKit
```

## Usage

### ðŸ—£ Speech Recognition

```swift
let recognizer = SpeechRecognizer()
recognizer.language = Locale(identifier: "en-US")
recognizer.onTranscriptUpdate = { print("Partial: \($0)") }
recognizer.onStop = { print("Final result: \($0 ?? "")") }

recognizer.startRecording()
// ...
recognizer.stopRecording()
```

### ðŸ”Š Speech Synthesis

```swift
let speaker = SpeechSynthesizer()
speaker.language = "pt-PT"
speaker.pitch = 1.2
speaker.speak(text: "OlÃ¡! Bem-vindo ao nosso app.")
```
